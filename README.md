# Sponsorship Crawler

## 10 February 2021 12:29 Notes

Selenium script works just fine without headless option turned on but can't find elements with headless Chrome browser. The sole reason why I tried to use a headless browser was to force the html-generating Javascript to treat my crawler as a legitimate browser and generate the webpage so that my crawler could operate without using an actual window. I need to do more research

Things got very complicated with Chrome very quickly so I switched to headless Firefox and it seems to work fine.
